# PF-Project.
This project implements various matrix operations in C++ including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, row/column averages, sorting, scalar operations, determinant and inverse (3×3). It supports both console and file input/output, showing practical use of arrays, loops, functions, and file handling.
# Matrix Operations in C++

This project is a console-based implementation of matrix operations using C++. It demonstrates how core programming concepts can be applied to solve mathematical and linear algebra problems effectively. The program supports both console and file input/output for flexible usage.
